# Sitegeist.MoveAlong

**Configure fallback nodes in case of 404**

## Summary

This package enables editable 404 pages. It allows you to configure several 404 pages in the page tree, in case you need different content or styling in different situations. 

**ATTENTION: This package will add a http-component via Settings.yaml. This component will try to find a matching 404 page for the current path an override the http-request accordingly.**

## Installation

Sitegeist.MoveAlong is available via packagist. Just run `composer require sitegeist/movealong`. We use semantic-versioning so every breaking change will increase the major-version number.

## Usage

### Settings

To activate Sitegeist.MoveAlong, the smallest configuration you're going to need is the following:

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  MoveAlong:
    enable: true
```

By default, Sitegeist.MoveAlong will match any requestPath and map it to `/404`. You can configure your own rules to handle Dimensions for example:

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  MoveAlong:
    rules:
      english:
        pattern: 'en\/.*'
        target: 'en/404'
      german:
        pattern: 'de\/.*'
        target: 'de/404'
```

The rule pattern and targets support pattern matching and replacement:

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  MoveAlong:
    rules:
      main:
        pattern: '^(en|de)\/.*'
        target: '$1/404'
```

!!! Regardles of any existing `defaultUriSuffix` configuration, you need to omit that uri part. So, if your 404 page is reachable via `404.html`, you need to configure `404` as your target.

If you just want to override the default behavior, you can overwrite the pre-configured `all` rule:

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  MoveAlong:
    rules:
      all:
        target: 'NotFound' # will display NotFound.html
```

If you want to change the order in which the rules apply, you can add a `position` argument to your rule configuration:

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  MoveAlong:
    rules:
      english:
        ...
      german:
        position: 'before english'
        ...
```

If you want to return a 410-gone status for an obsolete section you can configure this:

```yaml
Sitegeist:
  MoveAlong:
    rules:
      fileadmin:
        position: 'before all'
        pattern: '^fileadmin.*'
        target: '410'
      all:
        ...
```

### Fusion

Since the fallback mechanism will cause Neos to think, that a node has been found, the system won't respond with a 404 status code anymore. Therefore, some Fusion configuration is applied, to determine, whether we are on an error page and then send a 404 status code accordingly.

By default, that Fusion will assume, that your error page will have a `uriPathSegment` property that is set to `404` or `410`.

If this is not the case for your configuration, you can simply apply a different rule for that by overriding the `Sitegeist.MoveAlong:Match404Page` or the `Sitegeist.MoveAlong:Match410Page` prototype :

```fusion
prototype(Sitegeist.MoveAlong:Match404Page) {
  condition.@process.isNotFoundDocument = ${value && q(node).property('is404Page') == true}
}
```
